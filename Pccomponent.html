    <h1>Primary PC Components</h1>

    <h2>1. Summary</h2>
    <p>This excerpt provides an overview of the essential components of a desktop computer, including the system unit, CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these components for building and troubleshooting PCs, as well as the differences between open and closed case systems.</p>

    <h2>2. In-Depth Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Primary PC Components:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>: Often referred to as the brain of the computer, it performs calculations and processes data.</li>
        <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong>: Temporary storage that the CPU uses to hold data for currently running programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Devices</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HDD (Hard Disk Drive)</strong>: Traditional storage with spinning platters, used for long-term data storage.</li>
                <li><strong>SSD (Solid State Drive)</strong>: Faster storage that uses flash memory, often in M.2 form factor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</strong>: Handles rendering of images and video, crucial for gaming and graphic-intensive tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Open vs. Closed Case Systems:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Case</strong>: Allows for easy access to components for building and troubleshooting.</li>
        <li><strong>Closed Case</strong>: More compact and often better for airflow and cooling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I/O Ports and Connectors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>USB Ports</strong>: Used for connecting peripherals like keyboards, mice, and external drives.</li>
        <li><strong>HDMI/DVI/VGA</strong>: Video output ports for connecting monitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethernet Port</strong>: For wired network connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Key Terms and Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">System Unit</span>: The main body of a computer that houses the CPU, RAM, storage, and other components.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">CPU</span>: The component that performs calculations and processes data.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">RAM</span>: Temporary memory used by the CPU to store data for running applications.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">HDD</span>: A traditional storage device that uses spinning disks to read/write data.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">SSD</span>: A faster storage device that uses flash memory.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">GPU</span>: A specialized processor for rendering graphics.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">I/O Ports</span>: Input/Output ports for connecting peripherals and external devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Examples and Scenarios</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Building a Gaming PC</strong>: When building a gaming PC, prioritize a high-performance GPU and sufficient RAM to handle modern games.</li>
        <li><strong>Using Open Case for Troubleshooting</strong>: An open case allows for easier access to components when diagnosing issues, such as checking connections or replacing parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying Ports</strong>: Familiarize yourself with the various ports on a motherboard to ensure compatibility with peripherals, such as using USB-C for modern devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Study Tips & Memory Aids</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mnemonic for PC Components</strong>: "C R S G" (CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU) to remember the core components of a PC.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Aids</strong>: Create diagrams labeling each component in a computer case to reinforce learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-On Practice</strong>: Build a simple PC or disassemble an old one to familiarize yourself with the components and their connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Common Misunderstandings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confusing CPU with System Unit</strong>: Many learners mistakenly refer to the entire computer as the CPU. Clarify that the CPU is just one component of the system unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Assuming All Storage is the Same</strong>: Some may think HDDs and SSDs are interchangeable; emphasize the performance differences and use cases for each.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Exam Relevance</h2>
    <p>Expect questions on identifying components, understanding their functions, and knowing the differences between various types of storage and memory. Focus on the terminology and functions of each component.</p>

    <h2>8. Practical Actions & Exercises</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Component Identification</strong>: Take apart an old computer or use a virtual PC building tool to identify and label each component.</li>
        <li><strong>Cable Management</strong>: Practice organizing cables in a case to improve airflow and aesthetics.</li>
        <li><strong>Use PCPartPicker</strong>: Explore PCPartPicker to understand compatibility between components when building a PC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Optional Deeper Dive</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research Peripheral Devices</strong>: Investigate different types of peripherals (e.g., printers, webcams) and their connectivity options.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore Future Technologies</strong>: Look into emerging technologies in storage (like NVMe SSDs) and how they impact performance.</li>
    </ul>
